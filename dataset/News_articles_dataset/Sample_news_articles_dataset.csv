TRICHY: Tamil Nadu Pollution control board (TNPCB) has decided to carry surprise inspection across city on Monday to prevent people from burning things as part of Bhogi festival that would lead to pollution.

Bhogi bonfire is one of the rituals where useless household articles are thrown into fire. But in recent times, this ritual of bonfire has become the cause of immense air pollution due to burning of plastic items and rubber tyres.

Trichy district environmental engineer, R Lakshmi said that teams have been formed to carry inspection to prevent such happenings in the city. Some of the locations have been identified in the city where officials would carry inspection to prevent incidents of burning pollutants like plastic or rubber, Lakshmi added.

“While there are no plans to penalize people as of now, however, they will be instructed not to indulge in such activities,” she said.

Smoke emitting due to the bonfire remain in atmosphere for the next few days and as it is winter season, visibility remains low during the early hours due to fog and it will be further affected if smoke from bonfire remains in the atmosphere, she added.

The fundamentals of Bhogi festival are to eliminate the old and unused materials but that can also be done in other ways. People can donate their unused articles like clothes and other material to people in need, she said. K C Neelamegam, secretary of Thaneer – a city-based environmental organization, said that such incidents have come down in the recent time. This is mainly because most of the houses do not have tyres or unused plastic materials, which have already been removed as part of the anti-dengue initiatives.

Students are being made to take oath in the morning assembly against burning of pollutants as part of Bhogi festival, said chief educational officer, M Ramakrishnan.

LUCKNOW: In keeping with its promise to double income of farmers, the state government has decided to buy agricultural waste and wean away farmers from stubble burning, which accelerates air pollution.To provide a tech fillip, the state government set up a bio-coal production unit in Risia in Bahraich district, where the trial-run of manufacturing fuel briquette pellet from agro-waste was successfully completed recently. Paddy straw, corn stalks, sugarcane leaves are being bought at Rs 1500-2000 per quintal from farmers of the region and ploughed into the Bahraich plant. And around 10,000 quintals have also been bought from farmers so far, a state government spokesperson said. This is the first plant in the state, which is making fuel briquettes from agricultural residue. The unit has received an order for pellet supply of 1000 tonnes per day by Unchahar unit of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).The unit has also provided direct and indirect employment to over 100 persons while boosting income of farmers from agriculture waste. Agriculture produce commissioner, Alok Sinha, said, this will help eradicate the problem of stubble burning and management of agriculture residue. “We are motivating others to set up such units in the state for manufacturing pellets,” said Sinha.Government officials said, the cost of setting up the plant is around Rs 3.10 crore. The trial has also been completed by sending 106 quintal fuel briquette pellets to NTPC for producing electricity. The state government has also provided an exemption of 2.5% on GST for 10 years and a 25% grant on capital cost will also be provided. The officials said, two proposals from Shahjahanpur and one each from Pilibhit, Faizabad, Basti and Gorakhpur have been received to set up similar plants and training is being imparted on ways to manufacture pellets from agricultural residue by mixing with coal.","Pankaj Shah / TNN / Updated: Jan 25, 2021, 06:57 IST","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80440297,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-139597,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",,lucknow,2021.0,uttar pradesh,lucknow,"{'air pollution': 1.0, 'stubble burning': 2.0}"

Sharing this information with TOI, PMRDA commissioner Kiran Gitte said, “Besides the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority, PMRDA has been selected for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Swedish government.”

The “2,000-watt society” is an environment vision that was introduced in Sweden in 1998. It mainly focused on the need to reduce average primary energy usage to not more than 2,000 watts (48 kilowatt hours per day) by 2050 without making citizens lowe their standard of living.

The draft DP of the Mhalunge township may be published in the coming week and is expected to draw nearly Rs7,000-Rs 9,000 crore worth of investment in the coming two to three years, Gitte said.

He said they would look at investment from Swedish companies that have advanced solutions for smart energy, urban transportation, waste management and air quality.

NEW DELHI: Mayors of three municipal corporations on Monday started operating their “open-air offices” from outside the chief minister’s residence. Meetings with senior officials were held and several files were cleared at the site of the protest, which entered its eighth day. The three mayors, Leaders of the Houses and standing committee chairpersons along with 20 councillors have been protesting outside the CM’s residence seeking release of “pending dues worth Rs 13,000 crore”. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash held meetings with additional commissioners, heads of the departments and deputy commissioners of all six zones along with the elected functionaries. Twenty-five files were cleared, the civic body’s spokesperson said. Prakash directed the education department not to ask old age employees and those with co-morbidities to report on duty in view of their vulnerability towards the novel coronavirus. “I have also told officials to organise property tax camps,” he said. South Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Anamika Singh said that more than 20 female councillors have been spending days and nights under open sky. “Why can’t CM meet us? We will not leave unless our demands are met. We do not want any delay in day-to-day work and hence, we have started working from the protest site,” she added. “I have reviewed progress of the work done over the last one week and gave necessary directions to officials,” she said. Responding to AAP’s allegations of cameras being vandalised, she added: “The CM has allowed installation of new CCTV cameras near the protest site, which violates the privacy of protesting women councillors.” East Delhi corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said: “I discussed issues related to the remediation of Ghazipur landfill site and efforts being taken to mitigate air pollution. I directed officials that the 2024 target of clearing the landfill site should be met.” Meanwhile, the north corporation mayor said that if the salaries of sanitation staff were not paid soon, they might also go on strike and Kejriwal would be responsible for it. Delhi BJP said that safai karamchari association and 34 other employee unions had extended their support to the dharna.

However, it again surged by three notches over the last 24 hours and stood at 373 on Friday evening, remaining in the ‘very poor’ category.The CPCB states that ‘very poor’ category of AQI can lead to respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure.The AQI is an assessment of the air quality taking into account eight pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 micron), nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, ammonia and lead.PM2.5 has been found to be the biggest contributor of the high AQI in Patna. The average level of PM2.5 in Patna’s air on Friday was around 214.29 micrograms per cubic metre, over two times the corresponding daily permissible limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre.Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman Ashok Ghosh attributed the reason behind gradual plunge in the AQI to meteorological factors. “Temperature fluctuations and thermal inversion led to surge in AQI earlier this week. However, the fall in temperature has been lately stable which has led to a plunge in the AQI,” Ghosh said, adding it was a normal phenomenon at this time of the year due to transition season.The BSPCB chairman claimed that several factors, including alluvial soil in the city and sandy areas in the riverine areas of the Ganga, were responsible for the high level of PM2.5. “Plantation activities in the riverine areas can curb pollution to a great extent. Besides, net on construction sites and stringent pollution checks of vehicles can bring down the level of pollutants in the city,” Ghosh said.According to health experts, air pollutants such as particulate matters trigger allergies, cough, lung infections, irreversible lung damage, asthma , high blood pressure, tiredness, anxiety, diabetes and heart disease.“Very poor air quality prescribes minimal outdoor exposure during peak pollution period which is normally in the late evening and early morning hours. Curtailing outdoor activities, including morning walks, in such air quality is a standard practice across the world,” said city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejashwi.","Piyush Tripathi / TNN / Updated: Nov 24, 2018, 13:25 IST","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-66779903,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-120447,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",,patna,2018.0,bihar,patna,"{'air quality': 5.0, 'aqi': 7.0, 'carbon monoxide': 1.0, 'pm2.5': 4.0, 'pm10': 1.0, 'ozone': 1.0, 'sulphur dioxide': 1.0, 'air pollutants': 1.0}"

The study, which is called ‘Circulating Tyres in the Economy’, further suggests that ELTs should be utilised in building new roads to reduce the burden on landfill sites, ensuring that they are optimally used.According to data, 127.34 million tyres were produced in India in 2016-17 — an increase of 12% from the previous year — out of which 60% tyres ended up at landfill sites or got incinerated. The study also highlights how the tyres can have a ‘bubble’ effect, trapping methane gas at landfill sites and contaminating groundwater.“The ‘bubble’ effect has the potential to damage the landfill liners that are installed to help keep landfill contaminants in check, thus leading to a higher probability of polluting not just the ground surface but also the groundwater,” the study said.Experts feel that while policies exist to utilise tyres in such a manner for new roads, its implementation is lacking and there needs to be a focus on that, which the report has suggested. “The explosion of ELTs requires that the rubber literally hits the roads so that it can be controlled. Technology has to speak if we want environmental solutions to manage our landfill sites and control air and land pollution. We also need to implement our policies better,” said Bharati Chaturvedi, director at Chintan, adding that they hope the report is likely to boost efforts in this sector once again.Findings of the study further said that the other option taken across the country included burning of these tyres, which was again releasing toxic pollutants in the air.“The process of burning of rubber results in the emission of carcinogenic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, dioxin, furans and oxides of nitrogen, which are extremely hazardous to the environment and human health,” the report stated.Chintan, in the study, asks the ministry of road transport and highways to enforce the circulars issued in 2000 with regard to using Crumb Rubber Modified Bitumen — a material derived from tyres that can be used for construction of roads. The study also suggests reusing tyres by using techniques like regrooving and retreading, or recycling them through the formal sector while strengthening the informal sector. “ELTs need to be safely brought back to the system, either through recycling or reuse or by using them through roads. This will serve the dual purpose of not harming the environment and help the economy as well,” said Chitra Mukherjee, head of programmes, operations at Chintan.Rajiv Budhraja, director general of Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association, said that India is currently importing three lakh tonnes of tyres each year as there was no system of collection. He added that improvement is now expected under the new Waste Tyres Management Rules where tyre dealers have to maintain inventories of sales.","Jasjeev Gandhiok / Jasjeev Gandhiok / Updated: Apr 3, 2018, 00:29 IST","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63587159,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-154477,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",,delhi,2018.0,delhi,central delhi,{'air pollution': 1.0}

The dust collected will be disposed of at landfill sites for which the corporations have been taken on board.</p> <p> The road chosen for the first trial is unlike others in the capital. It is wide, smooth, debris-free and no one parks cars on it. So the government’s response — an official expressed happiness and said the vacuum cleaning had “worked well” — may have been exaggerated. The real test will come late on Friday night when the mechanical sweepers contend with the roads between Noida gate and Gandhinagar, Naraina and AIIMS and Mayapuri and Vikaspuri. There the government will reacquaint itself with the problems that the street sweepers faced when first deployed in 2010: obstructions, trash, uneven road surface and cars parked at the sides, all preventing a smooth glide across the stretch to be cleaned.</p> <p> The Barapullah trial’s daytime cleaning is also not replicable, and the government said the machines will only work at night so as not to disrupt traffic. They will be operated only every 3-7 days on roads that are deemed to be in need of cleaning.</p> <p> In fact, PWD hopes the vacuum cleaners will not be required frequently later. “Since we have started a massive greening drive in which all central verges and footpaths will be covered with plants, dust will automatically reduce and we will need to use <img align=""bottom"" cci_text_str=""<01Justify>"" src=""http://10.200.60.60:7003/newsgate/images/SmallCode.png"" />less of these machines,” said an official.</p> <p> The government has got 4-5 road sweepers on contract, but has begun the tendering process to acquire 20-odd machines, which are likely to be available in two months’ time. “We had promised to start the mechanised sweeping before the beginning of the second phase of the odd-even traffic scheme, so we hired some machines temporarily,” said the official.</p> <p> Along with the road cleaning, the government is also working to sensitise workers at construction sites to the need not to leave debris or loose earth lying in the open. “Right now, dust control protocols aren’t being followed and we have to take strict measures to see that at least government construction projects set an example for other contractors,” said PWD officials.</p>

Rapid and poorly regulated urbanisation has overwhelmed urban governments, rendering them >incapable of providing even basic services such as clean water, sewerage, pedestrian-friendly roads, public transport, uninterrupted power, street lighting, parks and recreational spaces. So weak and uncoordinated is governance that commercial entities have wilfully violated building regulations and put up unauthorised structures — with severe impact on congestion, air quality and flood management — and governments have gladly regularised the violations later. The >smart city plan now proposes to intervene and bring some order by upgrading the physical infrastructure in select enclaves, and incentivising the use of information and communication technologies. Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu has come up with a generalised definition of a smart Indian city as one that “enables a decent life to the citizens, and green and sustainable environment, besides enabling adoption of smart solutions”, but the exercise should lead to measurable outcomes.

> Also read: What are Smart cities?

The first batch of smart cities would create virtually new business districts in several cities, marking a departure from the disaggregated urban development witnessed over the past few decades. This area-based development approach makes it imperative that the resulting demand for mobility to and from the ‘smart’ area be made an integral part of the plan, with an emphasis on walkability, use of non-motorised transport and access to public transport. Ahmedabad and Bhubaneswar have shown high ambition by opting for a common travel card. Others such as Indore, Davangere and Belagavi plan Intelligent Transport Solutions, something that has been unattainable for even a big metro such as Chennai. Although it enjoys high visibility, the >smart city programme is merely a framework for urban development aided by the Centre with a small initial seed fund of Rs.500 crore, while additional finances have to come from public-private partnerships and local revenue. State governments, including those left out of the first list, could unlock the potential of all cities with development policies that aim at structural change. Improved public transport, for instance, has an immediate positive impact on the local economy. Technologies such as GPS to inform passengers in real time on their mobile phones, and common ticketing, increase the efficiency of transport use. Universal design in public buildings and streets would help all people, including those with disabilities. The challenge for Smart Cities 1.0 is to provide proof of concept quickly and make outcomes sustainable. Care also needs to be taken that the effect is not to create gated communities of best practices and civic upgrade in a wider landscape of urban distress. It is crucial that these urban enclaves cater to the housing, health, education and recreation needs of a wide cross section of society, and that the convergence of the Smart Cities programme with existing urban renewal projects countrywide be smooth.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,editorial,,,,,{'air quality': 1.0}
